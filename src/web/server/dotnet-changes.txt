CHANGES COMING IN .NET 3.5
==========================

(This is based on .NET 3.5 Beta 1, as compared on April 30, 2007)
(VALIDATED AS CORRECT on December 14, 2007 against RTM version of .NET 3.5)

- HttpListener appears to have many changes related to NTLM and Digest authentication, 
  none of which should have any effect on anything we do directly.  Any enhancements
  should be picked up automatically by virtue of just installing .NET 3.5
  
- HttpRequestStreamAsyncResult has a bug fixed that might allow us to properly
  use async processing there, but it's not very important feeling to me right now.
  UPDATE: There are no code changes in the final version; async still sucks
  
- HostingEnvironment now exposes the IApplicationHost-based object.  Don't think
  this does anything useful for us.
  
- HostingEnvironment still does NOT allow precompiled applications to work with a
  VirtualPathProvider unlike the changes to .NET 2.0 from the Vista Compatibility
  update to Visual Studio 2005. Make up your minds, please.
  
- WebHeaderCollection is NOT fixed, and since HttpListenerResponse still uses it
  we cannot get rid of the "header hack" yet.  HttpRuntime did have some changes
  that look like it would solve the cookie problem, but who cares if the listener
  classes don't leverage it properly?

SUMMARY: NOTHING OF ANY VALUE GOT FIXED IN .NET 3.5
