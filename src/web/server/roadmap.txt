- Local file system pass-through for the Structured Storage virtual file system
  NOTE: I'm not sure I really want to do this.  Not doing it would mean the loss
  of the connection string as well.  Perhaps not a bad thing.
  
- I want UriPrefixXXXX to have a ToString() override that emits a valid URL
  with host and port lookups as necessary. Probably a new ToString(String^ host).
  
- A special UriPrefix that accesses /temporary_listen_addresses on port 80
  for ease of use with Standard Users
  
- Rework everything to allow for a base URI in the prefix .. this is harder than
  it seems since we have everything coded to expect the virtual root to be the first
  thing in the request URI ... much work to do, this is a big feature
  
 - BUG: UriPrefixCollection::Remove (and likely others) removes by object not by 
   the key used in Contains()

- Custom VirtualPathProviders that tie into my model and use the Store connection
  string, etc.
  
- Enhance basic authentication; provide way for application to generate the token
  and build-in a cache that operates on a per-connection basis to not need HTTP 401
  with every single request

- Enable directory listings
